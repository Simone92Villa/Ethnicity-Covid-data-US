Therefore, it should be contextualized as, at best, an estimate of national testing performance.\n\nIn most states, the totalTestResults field is currently computed by adding positive and negative values because, historically, some states do not report totals, and to work around different reporting cadences for cases and tests. In Colorado, North Dakota, and Rhode Island, where reliable testing encounters figures are available with a complete time series, we directly report those figures in this field. In Massachusetts, where reliable specimens figures are available with a complete time series, we directly report those figures in this field. We are in the process of switching all states over to use directly reported total figures, using a policy of preferring testing encounters, specimens, and people, in that order.","prior_names":[]},{"field":"last_updated_time","deprecated":false,"name":"Last Update (ET)","definition":"Date and time in Eastern time the state or territory last updated the data.","prior_names":["lastUpdateEt","lastUpdateTime","checkTimeEt"]},{"field":"outcomes.death.probable","deprecated":false,"name":"Deaths (probable)","definition":"Total __fatalities with probable COVID-19 case diagnosis__ (per the expanded [CSTE case definition](https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/2020ps/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19.pdf) of April 5th, 2020 [approved by the CDC](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/case-definition/2020/)).
